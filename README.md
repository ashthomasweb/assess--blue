# Ash Thomas Coding Assessment

Hello,

Thank you for looking at my submission.


# Setup Instructions

Please extract the file to a directory of your choice

Run 'npm install'

The server and frontend need to be run concurrently

Please host the server on port 4000 using nodemon or similar

run 'npm start' to host frontend on port 3000


# Notes

I used my own prebuilt components and architecture for this project.

The database is on MongoAtlas in a dummy account. The full URL and password is directly in the server file. This is of course a security issue, but due to time I opted to hard-code the URL.

I always use a global state managment system like context or redux for extensibility. 

If I had more time, of course the URL would be made secure in an environment variable, the reducer types would not set to state directly from the payload, the API call would automatically update the list, and all formatting includes spacing would be in external stylesheets.

Thank you for taking the time to review,
Ash Thomas
